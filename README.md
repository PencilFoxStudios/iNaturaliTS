# iNaturaliTS
> A TypeScript module for interacting the the iNaturalist.org API.

## ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION
I am a full-time college student who took interest with iNaturalist.org's concept, and wanted to tinker around more with its API. This is why I am making this package. Because I am a full-time college student, I am working on this as a side project to coursework. 

## Contributing
I am pretty new to pull requests and open-source collaboration. If you want to implement more of the iNaturalist.org API, please feel free to send a pull request. Like I said above, I am a full time college student, so please be patient with me when waiting for an approval.
